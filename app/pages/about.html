        A web is a collection of instagram-styled posts all bundled together. They can be created and shared publicly for everyone to see.
        Webs are linked by topics that they share where every post within a web has a certain topic allocated to it. Feel free to get inspired
        by webs that others have created and search for webs that cover topics you are interested in.
