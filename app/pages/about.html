			A web is a collection of instagram-styled posts all bundled together. They
			can be created and shared publicly for everyone to see. Webs are linked by
			topics that they share where every post within a web has a certain topic
			allocated to it. Feel free to get inspired by webs that others have
			created and search for webs that cover topics you are interested in.
